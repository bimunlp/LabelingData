1
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:06,256
Dust of Snow
落雪

2
00:00:08,816 --> 00:00:12,584
The way a crow shook down on me
铁杉树上雀跃的那只乌鸦

3
00:00:12,648 --> 00:00:16,736
The dust of snow from a hemlock tree
抖落在我身上的浮雪

4
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:20,448
Has given my heart a change of mood
突然让我心情大好

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,464
And saved some part of a day I had rued.
不在懊恼
