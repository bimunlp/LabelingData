Sonnet 130 by William Shakespeare
莎翁十四行诗第130首​

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,820
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun.
我爱人的眼光并非阳光灿烂

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,680
Coral is far more red than her lips' red.
珊瑚也远比她的双唇红艳

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,940
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun.
她的胸脯也说不上雪白光鲜

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,180
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
满头乌丝 也无法比拟金线

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,020
I have seen roses damask'd, red and white.
我见过粉  红  雪白的玫瑰

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,620
But no such roses see I in her cheeks.
却没见一朵在她脸上绽放蓓蕾

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,260
And in some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
有很多馥郁芬芳的香水  比我情人的呼吸更令人陶醉

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,540
I love to hear her speak, 
我虽爱听她娇语呢喃

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,220
yet well I know that music hath a far more pleasing sound.
却知道  更好听的声音还是丝竹管弦

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,460
I grant I never saw a goddess go.
我也承认  我情人的举手投足之间

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,260
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.
没一点儿让我想起天仙下凡

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,180
And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare.
可是老天作证  我觉得我的爱人着实稀罕

14
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,340
As any she belied with false compare.
毫不逊色于那些矫饰的红颜
