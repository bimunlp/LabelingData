1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,456
A Warbler
鸣鸟

2
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:11,136
In the sedge a tiny song
草丛中传来一曲鸣唱

3
00:00:11,168 --> 00:00:14,536
Wells and trills the whole day long;
让一整天的好心情荡漾

4
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:19,816
In my heart another bird has its music heard.
心中传来另一个声音 唱出压抑已久的信心

5
00:00:20,328 --> 00:00:23,248
As I watch and listen here,
静  听  时起时落

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,088
Each to each pipes low and clear;
二重唱抑扬顿挫

7
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:30,064
But when one has ceased to sing,
一只已收场

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,064
Mine will still be echoing.
另一只还在唱
