1
00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:06,344
Moon Geese
雁飞月

2
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:11,904
You pressed the cold circle against my eye,
你把那冰冷的目镜贴在我的眼睛上

3
00:00:11,944 --> 00:00:13,808
I Jumped back,
眼前的一切使我惊讶不已

4
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:16,344
the moon so close
月亮离我如此之近

5
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:20,632
I thought it stuck to the end of the telescope.
仿佛是挂在望远镜上一般

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,248
Then a dark fleck showed,
接着  一片黑色的斑点出现了

7
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,488
grew darker, longer,
变得越来越暗  越来越长

8
00:00:27,576 --> 00:00:31,368
and I shouted at six geese rowing across a full moon.
我朝飞向满月的一行大雁欢呼
