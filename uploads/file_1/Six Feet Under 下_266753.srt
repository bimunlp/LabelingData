1
00:00:00,586 --> 00:00:13,733
Our love is six feet under, I can't help but wonder if our grave was watered by the rain

2
00:00:14,453 --> 00:00:20,960
Would roses bloom?

3
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:28,466
Could roses bloom?

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,853
They're playing our sound. Laying us down tonight

5
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:42,146
And all of these clouds crying us back to life

6
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:45,826
But you're cold as the night

7
00:00:47,546 --> 00:01:00,200
Six feet under, I can't help but wonder if our grave was watered by the rain

8
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,920
Bloom

9
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:14,706
Bloom

10
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:18,026
Again

11
00:01:23,594 --> 00:01:29,914
Help I lost myself again

12
00:01:30,217 --> 00:01:35,565
But I remember you
