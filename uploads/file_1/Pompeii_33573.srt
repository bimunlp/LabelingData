1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:13,408
I was left to my own devices
我受困于自己布下的局

2
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:20,768
Many days fell away with nothing to show
苦心经营多日依然一无所获

3
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:23,856
And the walls kept tumbling down
城墙仍在崩溃瓦解

4
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:28,016
In the city that we love
在这座我们热爱的城市中

5
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:36,184
Great clouds roll over the hills Bringing darkness from above
让无尽黑暗笼罩大地狂风暴雨席卷而来

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,360
But if you close your eyes,
但若是你闭上双眼

7
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:44,120
Does it almost feel like Nothing changed at all?
是否感觉 一切依旧如昔

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,872
And if you close your eyes,
若是你闭上双眼

9
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:49,264
Does it almost feel like
是否感觉

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,680
You've been here before?
你曾经亲临此地

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,528
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
为何我还能对一切如此乐观

12
00:00:56,568 --> 00:01:00,784
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
为何我还能对一切如此乐观

13
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:08,128
We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
我们深陷于堕落的泥沼中无法自拔

14
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:15,328
In your pose as the dust settles around us
尘埃泥土将我们完全掩埋

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,432
And the walls kept tumbling down
城墙仍在崩溃瓦解

16
00:01:18,488 --> 00:01:22,656
In the city that we love
在这座我们热爱的城市中

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:30,168
Great clouds roll over the hills Bringing darkness from above
让无尽黑暗笼罩大地狂风暴雨席卷而来

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,744
But if you close your eyes,
但若是你闭上双眼

19
00:01:33,856 --> 00:01:36,296
Does it almost feel like
是否感觉

20
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,712
Nothing changed at all?
一切依旧如昔

21
00:01:38,752 --> 00:01:41,520
And if you close your eyes,
若是你闭上双眼

22
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,848
Does it almost feel like
是否感觉

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,384
You've been here before?
你曾经亲临此地

24
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:51,192
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
为何我还能对一切如此乐观

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,248
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
为何我还能对一切如此乐观
