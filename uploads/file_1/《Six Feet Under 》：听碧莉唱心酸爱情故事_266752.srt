1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:06,413
Help, I lost myself again

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,146
But I remember you

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,560
Don't come back, it won't end well

4
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:26,720
But I wish you'd tell me too

5
00:00:27,253 --> 00:00:40,560
Our love is six feet under. I can't help but wonder if our grave was watered by the rain

6
00:00:41,493 --> 00:00:47,746
Would roses bloom?

7
00:00:48,426 --> 00:00:54,693
Could roses bloom

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,560
Again?

9
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:07,133
Retrace my lips. Erase your touch

10
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,400
It's all too much for me

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,213
Blow away like smoke in air

12
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:27,133
How can you die carelessly?
