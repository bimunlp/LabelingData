00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:12,400
it warms the ice.
暖化了冰层

3
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:22,240
Soon, the emperors' frozen world will start to melt away.

But its growing appetite will soon force both parents to go away fishing at the same time.
然而小企鹅的胃口越来越大 不久之后  父母只好同时离开去捕鱼

Now, both parents can head off to sea to go fishing.

For the first time, the chicks will have to face the elements
