1
00:00:03,074 --> 00:00:07,125
Sweetheart, do not love too long:   
亲爱的  莫在爱中深陷

2
00:00:08,085 --> 00:00:09,994
I loved long and long, 
我曾经如磐石痴心一片

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,891
And grew to be out of fashion
后来脱离时尚失却新鲜

4
00:00:13,988 --> 00:00:15,457
Like an old song.
如一首古老的歌曲一般

5
00:00:19,697 --> 00:00:22,034
All through the years of our youth
我们耗尽青春年华爱恋

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,028
Neither could have known their own thought from the other's,
彼此从来未曾得以分辨  俩人各自的想法与己见

7
00:00:27,168  --> 00:00:29,917
We were so much at one.
我们心有灵犀心心相连

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,960
But O, in a minute she changed-
可她突然就变了一张脸

9
00:00:36,777 --> 00:00:38,742
O do not love too long,
噢  莫在爱中深陷

10
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,057
Or you will grow out of fashion
否则会脱离时尚失新鲜

11
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:45,594
Like an old song.
如一首古老的歌曲一般
