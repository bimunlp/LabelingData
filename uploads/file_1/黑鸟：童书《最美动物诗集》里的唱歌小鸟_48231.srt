1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,672
The Blackbird
黑鸟

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:11,760
In the far corner close by the swings,
远处的角落 靠近秋千的地方

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,680
every morning a blackbird sings.
每天清晨一只黑鸟纵情歌唱

4
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:17,976
His bill’s so yellow,
黄色的喙

5
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:19,840
His coat’s so black,
黑色的毛

6
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:23,328
that he makes a fellow whistle back.
过路人不禁吹起了口哨

7
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:31,208
Ann, my daughter, thinks that he sings for us two especially.
我的女儿安认为它的歌喉专为我俩而响亮
