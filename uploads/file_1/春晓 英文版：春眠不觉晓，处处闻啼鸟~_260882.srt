00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,230
This spring morning in bed I'm lying,
春眠不觉晓

5
00:00:13,378 --> 00:00:16,276
Not to awake till the birds are crying.
处处闻啼鸟

6
00:00:17,243 --> 00:00:20,369
After one night of wind and showers,
夜来风雨声

7
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:24,449
How many are the fallen flowers!
花落知多少
