1
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:16,087
And they found the darkest deeds of my life kept coming,
接着他们发现了我从不间断的恶行

2
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,865
the blackest notes for my soul never stopped.
我内心最黑暗的一面一直在作祟

3
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,269
It seemed like it was always night time and nightmares, 
我的世界似乎总是黑暗   噩梦

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,087
and never morning.
永远到不了清晨

5
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:44,603
And maybe you wonder why.
也许你会好奇这到底是为什么

6
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:48,552
But mostly you try not to think about it,
但大多数时间你告诉自己不去想它

7
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,549
and try to get by,
尝试坚强挺过

8
00:00:51,607 --> 00:00:53,680
and try to survive.
尝试生存于此
