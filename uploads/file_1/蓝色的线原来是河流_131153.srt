What a lovely picture, Piglet.

You know, your blue lines remind me of something.

If only I could put my finger on it?

It looks like you already have your finger on it, Pooh.

Look.

The map's got the same wavery lines as Picasso's painting.
图纸和毕加索的画好像诶

Then the blue ones on the map must be picture of: The River!

And this must the bridge!
