00:00:05,781 --> 00:00:07,527
And slowly,
然而慢慢地

00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:10,800
slowly seasons changed around me.
慢慢地我周围的季节开始更换

3

that maybe the world would not be pulled out from under me again.
世界应该不会再次在我面前坍塌

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,803
Feet safe,
站稳足后

root's starting to grow.
芽根便开始生长

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,189
Little buds of hope for me.
小小的蓓蕾是我的希望所在

00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:33,381
Slowly, attempting to trust this new life.
慢慢地   尝试着去相信这新的生活
