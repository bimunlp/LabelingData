00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,736
Inuit Song
因纽特之歌

2
00:00:08,056 --> 00:00:09,600
SEA GULL
海鸥

3
00:00:09,632 --> 00:00:13,264
who flaps his wings over my head
扇动翅膀 飞过我的头顶

4
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:15,112
in the blue air,
飞向蔚蓝

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,456
you GULL up there
你直向云霄

6
00:00:17,488 --> 00:00:18,752
dive down
俯冲落下

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,560
come here, take me with you in the air!
来 带我走 飞向蔚蓝

8
00:00:23,336 --> 00:00:26,896
Wings flash by my mind’s eye
羽翼滑过我的心际

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,752
and I’m up there sailing in the cool air,
我已翱翔

10
00:00:30,956  --> 00:00:32,736
a-a-a-a-a-ah,
啊

11
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,730
in the air.
飞向蔚蓝
