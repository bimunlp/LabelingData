1
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:07,576
I Talk With the Moon
我和月亮聊天

2
00:00:08,464 --> 00:00:12,688
I talk with the moon, said the owl
猫头鹰说 我和月亮聊天

3
00:00:12,736 --> 00:00:15,984
While she lingers over my tree
月亮高挂枝头

4
00:00:16,288 --> 00:00:20,168
I talk with the moon, said the owl
我和月亮聊天  猫头鹰说

5
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:23,512
And the night belongs to me.
夜晚任我遨游

6
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:28,936
I talk with the sun, said the wren
鹪鹩鸟说 我和太阳聊天

7
00:00:28,984 --> 00:00:31,840
As soon as he starts to shine
阳光普照大地

8
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:35,928
I talk with the sun, said the wren
鹪鹩鸟说 我和太阳聊天

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,168
And the day is mine.
白昼任我嬉戏
