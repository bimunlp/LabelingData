00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:08,536
Three Little Owls Who Sang Hymns
唱赞歌的三只小猫头鹰

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,432
There were three little owls in a wood
森林飞出三小哥

3
00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:15,776
Who sang hymns whenever they could;
小猫头鹰唱赞歌

4
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,224
What the words were about
歌词到底唱什么

5
00:00:18,264 --> 00:00:20,344
One could never make out,
真是让人难琢磨

6
00:00:21,368 --> 00:00:24,688
But one felt it was doing them good.
反正开心就好了
