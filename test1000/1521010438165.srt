1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,616
Brooklyn is one of New York City's five boroughs,

2
00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:07,288
and is located on the western end of Long Island.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,776
A "borough" is just a word for a section of the city.

4
00:00:12,088 --> 00:00:16,304
Brooklyn has a population of nearly 2.6 million people.

5
00:00:16,824 --> 00:00:24,160
Most of those people are hipsters and live in neighbourhoods called Williamsburg and Park Slope.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,816
Many of Zach's friends want to create their own art.

7
00:00:29,264 --> 00:00:34,920
Erin, his girlfriend, wants to publish a book of poetry or a novel.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,160
"Where should we eat tonight, Zach?" Erin asks.

9
00:00:42,104 --> 00:00:48,320
She's wearing a long, floral dress that looks like it came from Little House on the Prairie.

10
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:52,728
"There's a little gastropub a block away that I've been wanting to try.

11
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:56,240
I hear the tables were engineered from old barn doors."

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,792
"Gastropub" is simply another word for "restaurant."

13
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:11,160
"I'm not really in the mood for monkfish and arugala and kale," Zach says.

14
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:16,752
When he lived in Lansing he used to eat things like hamburgers and pizza.

15
00:01:17,256 --> 00:01:19,016
"Can we just order in?"

16
00:01:19,192 --> 00:01:22,416
"Of course not!" Erin says.

17
00:01:22,744 --> 00:01:26,336
She tosses Zach his distressed Red Wing boots.

18
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:30,736
She makes a comment about how the boots were made for walking,

19
00:01:30,936 --> 00:01:37,696
which is a reference that Zach gets immediately because when you're a hipster you get references to songs.

20
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:41,304
There is a ton of pedestrian traffic in Brooklyn.

21
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:47,768
Zach feels like he spends most of his time walking or sitting on a train or trying to park a car.

22
00:01:48,504 --> 00:01:51,080
It leaves him very little time for writing.

23
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,680
Zach and Erin both went to the same small, liberal-arts college in Michigan.

24
00:01:58,544 --> 00:02:06,896
Zach was in a band called "Couch" whose claim to fame is that they once played in their school cafeteria.

25
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:16,768
Zach had 500 copies of Couch's debut CD made – 455 of which still reside in his apartment.

26
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,208
Erin double-majored in Environmental Science and Literature,

27
00:02:22,648 --> 00:02:27,976
meaning that she spent a lot of time reading Wendell Berry essays and poems.

28
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:33,424
They bonded over their shared love of being too clever for everybody else.
