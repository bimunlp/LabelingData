1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,900
I’m thirsty.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,140
I want to drink something.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,440
There’s water and tea.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,870
Is that water cold?

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,870
No. It’s hot.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,660
I don’t want hot water.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,000
How about some tea?

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,680
Is it cold?

9
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,330
No. It’s hot, too.

10
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,320
I don’t want hot tea.

11
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,560
Then you can have some cold milk.

12
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,630
OK. I like cold milk.

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,380
I will have an ice cream.
