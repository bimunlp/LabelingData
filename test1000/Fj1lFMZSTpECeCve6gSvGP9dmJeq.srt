00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,290
I'm sitting next to a woman who's talking really loud on her phone!

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,280
And the driver is driving too fast!

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,520
- Wait, Mom, no! Uh, uh, shuttle? - Oh, God.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,060
Al, stop itching. You're getting dead skin all over that baby.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,520
- Linda, I have to call you back. - Wait, Ma, don't...

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,500
- Ugh. So they got on a shuttle. - Yeah, I heard.

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,260
Both sides of the conversation. Because it was your mom.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,150
That's why we call her Grandma Speakerphone.

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,780
All right, all right, don't worry.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,910
We'll, uh... we'll find them. I mean, h how many shuttles can there be?

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,830
Oh. Lots.

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,900
-Crap.  -I think you mean, "holy shuttle."
