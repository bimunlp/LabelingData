1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,550
They had solved the problem, or so they thought.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,050
Then one mouse asked, "Who will put the bell on the cat?"

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,625
STOP AND CHECK

4
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:13,125
What happened after the old mouse shared his idea?

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,575
The mice looked at the old mouse.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,200
It was his idea.

7
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,950
"Not I," he said.

8
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:21,300
"That is a job for a younger mouth."

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,400
STOP AND CHECK

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,125
What was the solution to the problem?

11
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,550
But none of them would do it.

12
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:31,275
Fables are stories with lessons.

13
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,925
The lesson here is: "Easier said than done."
