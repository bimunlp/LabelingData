1
00:00:00,011  --> 00:00:02,255
I want to live simply.

2
00:00:03,777 --> 00:00:05,088
As in alone?

3
00:00:05,444 --> 00:00:07,580
I want to live in the country.

4
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:10,822
You couldn't live in the country, Doll.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,600
If we sold our house, we'd clear the debt.

6
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:15,066
Mum and Dad would let us live in
the old house. They'd love it.

7
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:17,377
It's just sitting there,
being dusty and charming.

8
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:24,466
It'd just be us again --
you, me, and the kids.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,800
No distractions.

10
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:31,155
You are the best.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,377
Come here.

12
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:39,822
Thank you.

13
00:00:41,100  --> 00:00:43,855
It's only a one-hour commute.
