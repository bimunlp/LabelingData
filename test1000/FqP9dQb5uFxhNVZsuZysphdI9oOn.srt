00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,815
hello, Goosey McGooseface. My brother is really hungry.

2
00:00:04,857 --> 00:00:06,956
So? He can eat when we get there.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,342
You have no idea what you're in store for.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,660
No. No. No. Leave me alone!

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,040
Holy moly! Jeez! 

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:24,100
What the heck is-- Ow!

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,003
You didn't tell me about this. He's gone completely nuts. What are we supposed to do?

8
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:33,020
Hey there, little fella, feeling better?

9
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,780
I must have food right now.

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,950
Okay. Not good. Not good at all. Hold on, little bro.
