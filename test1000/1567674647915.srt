1
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:06,352
Crickets
蟋蟀

2
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:12,600
We cannot say that crickets sing
只缘羽翅的一振

3
00:00:12,632 --> 00:00:15,504
Since all they do is twang a wing.
蟋蟀所为不仅在歌唱

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,960
Especially when the wind is still
尤其是趁风停声寂

5
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:21,016
They orchestrate a sunlit hill.
他们精雕细刻着撒满阳光的山峦

6
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:23,576
And in the evening blue above
在夜晚深邃的幽蓝中

7
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:27,320
They weave the stars and moon with love.
他们编织着星星和月光爱的传说

8
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:30,584
Then peacefully they chirp all night
啁啾唤醒了静谧

9
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:35,024
Remembering delight, delight...
铭记愉悦  铭记愉悦
