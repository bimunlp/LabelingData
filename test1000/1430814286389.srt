OK, let's go to the pool now!
好了   现在我们可以去游泳池啦

2
00:00:03,632 --> 00:00:07,820
I think we should do something else first, Lucy, before we go.
我觉得在出门之前   我们还有件事要做   露西

00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,584
What?! Hmm...Yeah. Maybe it was't such a good idea.
什么事   呃   是啊   看来这主意是不太妙

00:00:16,248 --> 00:00:19,776
Anyway, as soon as we finish mobbing up, we'll all go to the pool.
总而言之   把地擦干之后   我们就可以一起去游泳池了

5
00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:22,264
To the pool? We don't need to.
去游泳池   我们不需要去了

00:00:22,348 --> 00:00:25,192
Thanks to your plan, the pool has come to us.
多亏你的好点子   游泳池已经跑来找我们了
