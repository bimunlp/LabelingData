1
00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:01,762
You’re Going to Die!

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,497
Read the passage and answer this question: Will Mrs. Brown die in a month?

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,405
Mrs. Brown is a rich woman in the village.

4
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:14,434
She has four shops and a big farm.

5
00:00:14,754 --> 00:00:18,750
She likes eating. But she doesn’t like sports or housework.

6
00:00:19,097 --> 00:00:24,514
In the morning, Mrs. Brown often goes shopping and drinks coffee with friends.

7
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:29,588
In the evening she watches TV and goes to bed late at night.

8
00:00:30,994 --> 00:00:32,560
What’s the matter?

9
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:35,417
I feel tired every day.

10
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:38,571
I’m worried because I’m too fat now!

11
00:00:38,891 --> 00:00:42,765
I’m sorry, madam. You are going to die in a month!

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,771
Mrs. Brown is very sad. She doesn’t eat or drink.

13
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:55,280
She cries and cries: “ Oh, my god, I’m going to die…”

14
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:57,691
She can’t sleep well at night.

15
00:00:59,394 --> 00:01:02,617
You see,doctor! I didn’t die.

16
00:01:02,868 --> 00:01:03,965
Yes, madam.

17
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:06,674
Doctor! You’re wrong!

18
00:01:06,982 --> 00:01:09,931
But look at you! Aren’t you thinner now?
