00:00:00,096 --> 00:00:01,464
I have a question.
我有一个问题

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,560
How does a ship move in the water?
船在水里是怎么前进的

3
00:00:06,952 --> 00:00:09,248
"Nathan, do you know that?"
Nathan  你知道吗  

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,140
It's the wind!
是风

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,512
The wind pushes the ship forward.
帆船靠风前进

6
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:16,336
Exactly!
没错

7
00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:19,464
What if the wind is from another direction?
但是  如果风是从其他方向来的呢

8
00:00:20,016 --> 00:00:23,344
For example the wind pushes the ship sideways?
比如风是从侧面吹来的呢

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,336
We can trim the sail to the wind.
我们可以调整船帆的方向

10
00:00:27,192 --> 00:00:28,056
I see.
明白了

11
00:00:29,216 --> 00:00:30,896
This is amazing!
真是太神奇了

12
00:00:33,272 --> 00:00:34,568
Amazing!
真神奇
