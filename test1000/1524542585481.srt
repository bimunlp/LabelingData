Hi, David.

00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,480
I want to go to the seaside.

00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:10,860
Where will you go?

00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,210
I'll go to Dalian.

00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,810
I can go swimming there.

00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,160
I can eat a lot of seafood, too.

10
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,160
Wow, sounds great!

13
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,170
