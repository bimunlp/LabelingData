00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,025
STOP AND CHECK

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,350
What have you learned about Rudy so far?

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,575
When Rudy turned five years old, his legs were removed.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,175
Then the doctors gave him his new legs.

5
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:16,400
The new legs were strong.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,375
They were made of plastic and metal.

7
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:22,950
Now Rudy could walk and run!

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,050
This leg is like the ones that Rudy got.

00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,400
Chapter 2 What Could Rudy Do?

10
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:38,625
Rudy played sports and learned how to swim.

11
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:41,200
He discovered a new interest.

12
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:46,250
He wanted to show people that he could do the same things they could.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,350
This made Rudy a hero.

14
00:00:51,325 --> 00:00:55,525
Rudy's new legs let him try new things.
