This weekend, I visited my aunt.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
She lives on a farm in the countryside.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,625
She keeps horses and teaches people how to ride them.

4
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:15,300
First, she showed me around the farm.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,622
It's very big!

6
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:21,050
Then she took me to see the horses,

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,350
It was time for lunch,

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,475
so she gave them some food.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,422
After that,

10
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:32,250
my aunt taught me how to ride a horse.

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,975
Then we rode the horses across the fields!

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,750
It was so exciting!

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,725
When we got back to the farm,

14
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:45,675
we cleaned the horses's tables

15
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,400
before we had dinner.

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,160
I really hope I can visit my aunt again soon.
