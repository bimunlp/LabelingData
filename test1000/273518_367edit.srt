There's no where to splash and swim.

Maybe you should come with me, to the North Pole?

The North Pole? Do they have puddles there?

I don't think so.

It's very cold and no body lives there.

Because that's where explorers go.

It would be an adventure.

OK! It's better than sitting on a frozen pond, I guess.
