00:00:00,551 --> 00:00:05,164
Lele, I’m so excited to see the animals at the zoo today.

2
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:06,515
Me, too, Kuan!

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,022
At the zoo, we can see that different animals live on different kinds of land and water.

4
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:16,320
Bats are land animals. They live in caves.

5
00:00:16,506 --> 00:00:17,555
Cool.

6
00:00:18,106 --> 00:00:22,551
Oh, these are camels. I really like camels.

7
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:26,951
I like them, too. Camels live on land…in the desert.

8
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:31,662
Pandas also live on land, but they live in forests.

9
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:34,906
I love pandas. They are so big!

10
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:39,146
I also love them. Pandas are my favorite animal.

11
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:42,968
This is an octopus. It lives in the sea.

12
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:47,057
Hmm, I don’t like the octopus. It’s ugly.

13
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,057
Really? I like it.

14
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:53,857
These are swans. They live on land and on lakes.

15
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:56,248
They also fly in the sky.

16
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:58,400
I think I like swans.

17
00:00:58,515 --> 00:00:59,706
Me, too!

18
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:04,337
Butterflies also live on the land and fly in the sky.

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,093
I like them because they are pretty.

20
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:09,520
Yeah, I also like them.

21
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:14,355
Ooh, and these are dinosaurs…I love dinosaurs!

22
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:20,675
Most dinosaurs lived only on land, but some dinosaurs lived in the sea,

23
00:01:20,826 --> 00:01:25,511
and some could fly in the sky, right?

24
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:30,800
Right. I hate them, though. Dinosaurs are so scary!

25
00:01:30,888 --> 00:01:36,168
Yeah, they are scary, but I think they’re also cool!
