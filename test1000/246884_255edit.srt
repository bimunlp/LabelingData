Who Would Like a Fish?

2
00:00:03,702 --> 00:00:05,417
Cat would like a fish.

3
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:07,965
She would not like vegetables.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,182
She would not like beef.

5
00:00:10,697 --> 00:00:12,788
She would not like noodles.

6
00:00:13,337 --> 00:00:16,708
One day, cat sees a fish in a bowl.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,040
She jumps and she jumps.

8
00:00:19,382 --> 00:00:21,485
But she can’t touch the fish.

9
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,234
She’s mad.

10
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:26,525
Cat pushes a chair next to the table.

11
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:28,697
She climbs on the chair.

12
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:31,131
She jumps and she jumps.

13
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,634
But she can’t touch the fish.

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,965
She’s mad with that fish.

15
00:00:36,060  --> 00:00:38,465
Dog comes in the room.

16
00:00:38,548 --> 00:00:41,188
“Would you like that fish?” asks Dog.

17
00:00:41,657 --> 00:00:45,451
“No, no, no! Who would like that fish?

18
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:48,297
Not me!” says Cat.

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,851
Fish looks happy. But cat does not.
