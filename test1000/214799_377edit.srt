00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,856
My name is Dryer

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,416
Today we have dance class

3
00:00:04,624 --> 00:00:07,504
First, we sit in a circle and stretch

4
00:00:07,568 --> 00:00:09,412
Let’s make a phone call

5
00:00:10,288 --> 00:00:12,624
Hello? Who are you?

6
00:00:12,768 --> 00:00:14,320
We stretch our legs

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,080
Then stretch your face

8
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:22,992
Roarrr…

9
00:00:23,708  --> 00:00:25,616
One more time, here we go

10
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:27,568
Roarrr…

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,024
We stump our feet and they make sounds

12
00:00:42,144 --> 00:00:43,952
And we slide back

13
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:48,736
And we spin

14
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:51,280
Make yourself into a snow person

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,016
Nice tab, nice shoulder, nice neck

16
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:59,728
And let’s smell, the sun is coming out
