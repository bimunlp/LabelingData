1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,553
We better get going.

2
00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:04,768
I'm sorry we kind of got off on the wrong foot, Mittens.

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:05,680
Friends?

4
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:08,592
I don't know. I'm kind of a loner.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,752
Except for Pig Robinson,of course.

6
00:00:10,848 --> 00:00:13,568
He's sort of like my...Beloved brother.

7
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:15,840
I was going to say distant cousin.

8
00:00:16,176 --> 00:00:19,536
Oh, all right. Sort of brother, I suppose.

9
00:00:19,744 --> 00:00:21,344
Mittens...

10
00:00:21,568 --> 00:00:25,616
All right, all right. I guess having a few rabbit friends too couldn't hurt.

11
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,184
Aww!

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,584
Oh,and a mouse friend.

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,520
Hey, I'm not a mouse!
