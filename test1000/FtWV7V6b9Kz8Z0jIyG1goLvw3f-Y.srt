1
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,746
So where are you working now, Terry?

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,746
Oh, I’m still at the bank.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,596
I don’t like it, though.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,886
That’s too bad. Why not?

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,206
Well, it’s boring, and it doesn’t pay very well.

6
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:18,830
I know what you mean. I don’t like my job, either.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,986
I wish I could find a better job.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,323
Actually, I don’t want to work at all anymore.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,870
I wish I had a lot of money so I could retire now.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,210
Hmm, how old are you, Terry?

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,946
Uh, twenty-six.
