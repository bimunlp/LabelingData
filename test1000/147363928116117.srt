In every story there is one villain,
每个故事里都有一个恶棍

a man or woman who wants nothing more than our hero to fail.

Yet in some stories, there may be two,
然而在另一些故事里有两个恶棍

00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:23,640
and when they meet, there must be a greater of the two evils.
当他们相遇时一山不容二虎

5
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,760
But then again, maybe not.
不过也许不是这样

00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:35,020
And instead there is just greater evil.
他们反而会变得更为邪恶
