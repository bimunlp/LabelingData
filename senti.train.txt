262624###Sonnet 130 by William ShakespeareMy mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun.Coral is far more red than her lips' red.If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun.If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.I have seen roses damask'd, red and white.But no such roses see I in her cheeks.And in some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.I love to hear her speak,yet well I know that music hath a far more pleasing sound.I grant I never saw a goddess go.My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare.As any she belied with false compare.###莎士比亚,抖森,诗歌,William Shakespeare,十四行诗,Sonnet 130,读诗,朗诵,朗读,风格,国外,深情,音色,绅士,为你读诗,国外诗歌,蓝光视频,诗歌演讲###2
