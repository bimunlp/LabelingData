1422003350398###Brooklyn is one of New York City's five boroughs,and is located on the western end of Long Island.A "borough" is just a word for a section of the city.Brooklyn has a population of nearly 2.6 million people.Most of those people are hipsters and live in neighbourhoods called Williamsburg and Park Slope.Many of Zach's friends want to create their own art.Erin, his girlfriend, wants to publish a book of poetry or a novel."Where should we eat tonight, Zach?" Erin asks.She's wearing a long, floral dress that looks like it came from Little House on the Prairie."There's a little gastropub a block away that I've been wanting to try.I hear the tables were engineered from old barn doors.""Gastropub" is simply another word for "restaurant.""I'm not really in the mood for monkfish and arugala and kale," Zach says.When he lived in Lansing he used to eat things like hamburgers and pizza."Can we just order in?""Of course not!" Erin says.She tosses Zach his distressed Red Wing boots.She makes a comment about how the boots were made for walking,which is a reference that Zach gets immediately because when you're a hipster you get references to songs.There is a ton of pedestrian traffic in Brooklyn.Zach feels like he spends most of his time walking or sitting on a train or trying to park a car.It leaves him very little time for writing.Zach and Erin both went to the same small, liberal-arts college in Michigan.Zach was in a band called "Couch" whose claim to fame is that they once played in their school cafeteria.Zach had 500 copies of Couch's debut CD made – 455 of which still reside in his apartment.Erin double-majored in Environmental Science and Literature,meaning that she spent a lot of time reading Wendell Berry essays and poems.They bonded over their shared love of being too clever for everybody else.

829edit###Feeding a hungry worldIn 1850, the total population of the world was 1 billion.  In 1930, it was 2 billion.  Today the number is over 6 billion.And it is increasing at the rate of nearly 8 million a month.  Many people think that by the year 2015, there will be more than 8 billion people on the earth.Will we be able to feed such a large population?  Already, two thirds of the people in the world do not get enough to eat.  At present, more than 15,000 people die of hunger every day.How can we increase the world’s food production?  Most of our food is produced by farming the land.Some scientists believe that we are only using less than half of the good land in the world.  So one way of increasing food production is to use more land for farming.However, as the population increases, more land is used to build houses, factories, shops and roads.  So there is less land for farming.  We have to produce more and more food from less and less land.There are also other ways to increase the world’s food production.  Scientists are trying to develop new ways of farming and trying to produce more grain on the same land.They are trying to find ways to get more food from the sea.  They are also developing new kinds of food, such as man-made cheese and meat.These new kinds of food will become more and more important in the future.But the population keeps on growing very quickly.  By the year 2035, there may be more than 16 billion people on the earth.  By 2050, there may be as many as 30 billion!Will it be possible to produce enough food for these people?  The day may come when the world’s population is too big for the earth to feed.
